# 🚀 Impossible Features

Welcome to **Impossible Features** — a wishlist of software features that sound amazing, magical, or futuristic… but may (probably) never exist.  

Or maybe they *will*? 👀

## 🎯 Goal
Document the wildest, most unrealistic, and most futuristic software features that we wish existed.  
Think of this repo as the **sci-fi of programming tools**.

## 🧩 Examples
- A compiler that rewrites broken code into correct code AND explains your mistakes in plain English  
- A debugger that not only finds the bug but tells you *why you made it*  
- An IDE that finishes your entire project after you describe it in a sentence  
- A version control system that predicts merge conflicts before they happen  

## 📌 How to Contribute
1. Fork this repo  
2. Add your idea under `/features/` with a short description  
3. Open a pull request and watch the Impossible Features Zoo grow 🚀

### 🤔 Why?
Because sometimes the impossible features of today become the standard tools of tomorrow.  
This repo is about dreaming bigger than “just another linter.”
